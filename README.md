# DadJokes
This Project generates a random joke on clicking the whenever the user clicks on the "Next Joke" button. It is made using Front-end Web development technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The joke are generated by fetching an API ("https://icanhazdadjoke.com/") using Async-Await. However, Promises can also be used to do the same task, which is why I have added the code for the same using comments.
